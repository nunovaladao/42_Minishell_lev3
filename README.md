# Minishell ðŸ’»

- This project was made in collaboration with [Nuno Tabuada](https://github.com/nunotaboada)!

## Introduction
Minishel is a project developed as part of the programming curriculum at 42. The project aims to build a simplified shell program capable of executing basic command-line operations.

By working on the Minishel project, i acquire a range of skills and knowledge, including:

- **Understanding of Unix systems**: I gain a deeper understanding of how Unix-based operating systems function, including processes, file systems, and command execution.
- **Process management**: I learn how to create and manage processes within the shell, including forking, executing commands, and handling process termination.
- **Command parsing**: I be able to understand to parse user input and interpret command structures, including handling arguments, options, and redirection.
- **Input/output handling**: I learn how to manage input/output streams, including reading from and writing to files, implementing pipes, and handling standard input/output redirection.
- **Signal handling**: I gain experience in handling signals and implementing signal handlers for various events, such as process termination or interruption.

## GRADE PROJECT âœ…
- 101/125 ðŸ“‹
- [**Subject**](https://github.com/nunovaladao42_Minishell_lev3/blob/main/extras/en.subject.pdf) 

## Installation
To get started with Minishel, follow the steps below:
1. Clone the repository via
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nunovaladao/42_Minishell_lev3.git
```

2. Move into the repository directory:
```bash
cd 42_Minishell_lev3
```

3. Build the project using the provided Makefile: 
```bash
make
```

4. Run Minishell:
```bash
./minishell
```

## Testing the Project
Once Minishel is up and running, you can test various commands and functionalities. Here are some commands you can try:

- **`ls`**: List files and directories in the current directory.
- **`cd`**: Change the current directory.
- **`echo`**: Display a line of text.
- **`pwd`**: Print the current working directory.
- **`cat`**: Concatenate files and display the output.
- **`mkdir`**: Create a new directory.
- **`rm`**: Remove files and directories.
- **`exit`**: Exit the shell.

Feel free to explore additional commands and experiment with different features of the shell. You can also combine commands using pipes (|) and input/output redirection (< and >).

## Skills and Competencies Acquired

The Minishel project provides an excellent opportunity to acquire and strengthen several essential programming skills, including:

- **Proficiency in C programming language**: I gain hands-on experience in writing C code and utilizing various language features, data structures, and system libraries.
- **Understanding of operating systems**: Through implementing a shell, i deepen understanding of how operating systems work, particularly Unix-based systems.
- **Problem-solving and debugging**: As i encountered challenges during the project, i develop strong problem-solving and debugging skills, enabling to identify and fix issues efficiently.
- **Collaboration and teamwork**: I have the opportunity to collaborate and practice effective teamwork, including code reviews and version control management.

## Conclusion
This project offers a valuable learning experience, allowing you to dive into the world of Unix systems, processes, and shell programming. By building a simplified shell, you will acquire essential skills that are fundamental to operating system development and system administration.

Through this project, you will not only enhance your technical abilities but also develop problem-solving skills, improve your understanding of programming concepts, and gain confidence in working with low-level systems. The knowledge and skills acquired from Minishel will serve as a strong foundation for your future endeavors in the field of software development and system administration.

## Note:

- [**Coding Norm**](https://github.com/nunovaladao/42_Minishell_lev3/blob/main/extras/en_norm.pdf) - All students must follow the 42 code writing standards. This standard is applied to many projects in the course.
- 42's projects are made and designed to work on the school's computers, so it is possible that when testing it, it may give an unexpected error.
